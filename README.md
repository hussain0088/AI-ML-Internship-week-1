## Project Workflow

**1. Data Analysis**

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and trends in the dataset.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data for modeling.

**2. Bank Client Data Analysis and Categorical Treatment**

Analyzed client-related data to identify key factors influencing term deposit subscription.
Applied categorical encoding techniques for non-numerical variables.

**3. Visualization**

Created insightful visualizations to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
Used plots such as histograms, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps.

**4. Model Implementation**

Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict term deposit subscription:

*Logistic Regression:* Achieved an accuracy of **89%.**

*K-Neighbors Classifier:* Achieved an accuracy of **89%.**

*Random Forest Classifier:* Achieved an accuracy of **89%.**

*Support Vector Classifier (SVC):* Achieved an accuracy of **84%.**

*Gaussian Naive Bayes:* Achieved an accuracy of **83%.**

**Results**

Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier were the top-performing models with an accuracy of 89%.
Support Vector Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes achieved slightly lower accuracies, at 84% and 83%, respectively.
